1.Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial because it keeps customers happy, avoids extra costs, and ensures that the project stays on track. If a project is delayed, it might lead to financial losses or missed opportunities in the market.
How to Meet Deadlines:
Proper Planning: Breaking tasks into smaller steps (Work Breakdown Structure - WBS).
Agile Approach: Working in small, manageable sprints.
Time Tracking: Using tools like Trello or Jira to monitor progress.
Effective Communication: Regular team check-ins to solve problems early.

2.How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Managing costs well helps prevent overspending and ensures the project remains profitable. If a project goes over budget, it may lead to financial issues or incomplete development.
Ways to Prevent Budget Overruns:
Accurate Budgeting: Estimate costs realistically based on past projects.
Scope Management: Avoid unnecessary additions (scope creep).
Regular Monitoring: Keep track of expenses and adjust as needed.


3.Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Feature	                  Agile	                                                 Waterfall
Flexibility   	        Highly flexible; changes can be made anytime	          Follows a strict plan
Development Style	       Incremental (small releases)                           	Linear (step-by-step process)
Customer Involvement   	Frequent feedback from clients	                         Clients are mostly involved in the beginning
Best For	                Projects with changing requirements                   	Projects with fixed requirements
Delivery	                    Continuous releases                                  	One final delivery
_Advantages of Agile:_
Faster feedback from users.
Easier to adapt to changes.
_Disadvantages of Agile:_
Can be hard to predict final costs.
Needs frequent communication.
__Advantages of Waterfall_:
Clear structure and documentation.
Works well for well-defined projects.
_Disadvantages of Waterfall_:
Hard to change requirements later.
Testing happens late, increasing the risk of errors.

4.In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
_Agile is best for:__
Mobile apps (e.g., Instagram updates).
Startups developing new products.
_Waterfall is best for:_
Government projects (e.g., tax systems).
Banking software (where requirements are strict).

5.What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
o make sure the software works well and has no major bugs, quality assurance (QA) is essential. Poor quality software can lead to security issues, bad user experience, and company reputation damage.
QA Methods:
Testing: Automated and manual testing.
Code Reviews: Developers check each other’s work.
User Testing: Getting feedback before release
